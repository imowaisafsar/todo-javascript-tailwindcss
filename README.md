# ToDo List Application

A simple, user-friendly ToDo list application. It's built using HTML, and JavaScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS. The application supports adding and deleting tasks. All tasks are persisted in the browser using the localStorage API.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the ToDo list
- Delete tasks individually
- Tasks persist across browser sessions using localStorage

## How to Use

Simply type your task into the input field and click the "Add" button to add a new task to the list. If you wish to remove a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task.

## Learning Objectives

This project is a demonstration of the following concepts:

- Basic DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Handling browser events (onClick, DOMContentLoaded)
- Using localStorage to persist data across browser sessions
- Integrating a CSS framework (Tailwind CSS) into a project

## Note

This is a simple learning project and may not be ready for production use without additional features and optimizations.
